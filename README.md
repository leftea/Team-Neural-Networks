The purpose of this repo is to provide an introduction to the theory of ANNs (Artifical Neural Networks) and demonstrate their applications on data. 

Artificial Neural Networks are brilliant, complex systems inspired by biological neural networks - the network of cells in your body that communicate via chemical and electrical impulses, and pave way for reasoning, decision making, planning, acting, thinking, you name it. These artificial neural network models can be used for all sorts of problems, including the classification and regression problems demonstrated in this repo.

We presented on a few types of ANNs: The [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron "Perceptron wiki article") and the [Multilayer Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron "Multilayer Perceptron wiki article") network.
